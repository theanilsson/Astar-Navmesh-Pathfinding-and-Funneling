# Astar-Navmesh-Pathfinding-and-Funneling
A clean and efficient implementation of the A-Star algorithm and an accompanying funneling algorithm, used for finding the shortest path on navigation meshes

The functions for loading and initializing the NavMesh data from obj files were not produced by me.</br>
The rest of the implementation was entirely produced by me.
